Interesting layer4 attacks:


   SYN/ACK Flooding:
        Exploiting the TCP three-way handshake process, attackers can flood a target server with a high volume of SYN or SYN-ACK packets, 
        causing resource exhaustion and disrupting normal operation.

    TCP/IP Hijacking:
        Involves manipulating TCP/IP packets to take control of an established TCP connection. This may be done through techniques
        like session hijacking or man-in-the-middle attacks.

    Session Hijacking (TCP Session Hijacking):
        Intercepting and taking over an established session between two parties. This often involves
        stealing session cookies or session IDs.

    UDP Reflection/Amplification Attacks:
        Similar to DDoS attacks, but leveraging UDP (User Datagram Protocol). Attackers can send 
        a small amount of traffic to a vulnerable server, which then responds with a much larger volume of data to the victim.

    Reset Spoofing (RST Attack):
        Sending forged TCP reset (RST) packets to terminate an existing TCP connection, 
        disrupting communication between two parties.

    Ping of Death:
        Sending malformed or oversized ping packets to a target, exploiting vulnerabilities
        in the way the target handles ICMP packets.
